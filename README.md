# Remote File Server using RPC

This project implements a remote file server that allows clients to perform file operations (e.g., read, write, delete) over a network using Remote Procedure Call (RPC) communication. It demonstrates principles of distributed systems, networking, and concurrency.

## Features

- Remote file read, write, and delete operations
- Custom RPC-based communication protocol
- Concurrent request handling
- Simple error reporting and validation
- Modular and extensible architecture
